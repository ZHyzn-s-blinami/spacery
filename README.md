### Overview
This project is a comprehensive solution for managing coworking space bookings. It provides a fast, reliable, and user-friendly platform for reserving desks and rooms. The system ensures real-time updates of available spaces and prevents double-booking, offering a seamless experience for students, employees, and guests.

### Tech Stack & Security
- **Java Spring:** A robust and secure framework for building backend services. It comes with built-in security features (e.g., Spring Security) to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, scalability, and strong data integrity.
- **React:** A modern JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces using a component-based architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates UI development while ensuring consistent and responsive design.
- **RTK (Redux Toolkit):** Simplifies state management in React applications, reducing boilerplate code and providing a structured approach to handling state securely.

This stack has been chosen based on industry best practices. Each component is widely adopted in production environments, is rigorously tested, and benefits from active community support and regular security updates.
